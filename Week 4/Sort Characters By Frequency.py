Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:

Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:

Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

Example 3:

Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        d={}
        for i in s:
            if i in d:
                d[i]+=1
            else:
                d[i]=1
            
        print(d)
        x=sorted(d,key=lambda x: d[x],reverse=True)
        print(x)
        # print(sorted(d,reverse=True))
        z=''
        for i in x:
            print(i*d[i])
            z+=i*d[i]
        print(z)
        return z
